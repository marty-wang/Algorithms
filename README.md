# Objective

The idea of the project is to use JavaScript to visualize the mechanics of the common Computer Science algorithms, so that hopefully it can help people understand some basic yet obscure theories.

# Structure

The **src** folder contains all the algorithm code, and the **app** folder contains the demo/visualization code. The purpose of such organization is to ensure that these algorithm code can be re-used somewhere else, while the demo/visualization code is merely for visualization.

The algorithm code is written in *CoffeeScript*, and fully tested with *Jasmine*.
